# infrastructure-101
fiddling with infrastructure 


# problem - supercloud 

the initial test is to experiment with Supercloud. 

A supercloud refers to computing environment or platform that is designed to work seamlessly across multiple cloud services. 

We will experiment with how it would look to setup a simple solution in three cloud infratstructures

We will implement a front-end using a back-end microservice (HelloWorld) and when it works to access the same solution on the three infrastructures. 

So how do we do this? What can we learn from it? 


# solution - first pass 

- We will use VS code, Git and Github as a start and create a repository for it. 
- we will write a microservice in Node.js that will be deployed to all the cloud platforms 
- Create a dockerfile to encapsulate the services (alternative is to use serverless - but we do a first try)
